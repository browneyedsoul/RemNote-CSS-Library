# CONTRIBUTION GUIDE

## From Maintainer

- We've been building this project in Viual Studio Code with Sass compiler.

  - https://github.com/glenn2223/vscode-live-sass-compiler

  - Since the node-sass has been deprecated, it will gradually be a dart-sass based project in due season.

- the `*.css` files are only controlled and compiled by `*.scss` files in the `SCSS` directory.

  That means PRs are allowed to `*.scss` with the compiled `*.css` files.

## Convention

- *.scss : 4 space opinionated for consistency and readability.
